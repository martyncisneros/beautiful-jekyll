I am currently a <strong>Data Analyst</strong> at a boutique healthcare consulting firm called <a href="http://healthcare-consulting.org" target="_blank">Healthcare Excellence Institute</a>, I help hospitals improve their funding of quality care delivery by creating models that predict insurance payments. This healthcare consulting experience has allowed me to acquire the foundational knowledge base for becoming a data scientist. Big data, alternative reimbursement methods, and distribution of stakeholder information are coalescing to re-define the healthcare industry. I aspire to maximize my impact in this shifting healthcare landscape by leveraging advanced analytics to transform prevention and care coordination. 

Previously, I was the <strong>Director of Operations</strong> at <a href="https://www.enplug.com/" target="_blank">Enplug</a>, a tech startup featured on Inc. magazine’s <a href="http://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/2015-30-under-30-enplug.html" target="_blank">30 under 30</a> List. In that position, I led monthly business and operational model adjustments, developed our hardware supply chain management and techincal support center, and created business intelligence for our operations.
