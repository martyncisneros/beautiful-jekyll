I am currently a <strong>Data Analyst</strong> at a boutique healthcare consulting firm called <a href="http://healthcare-consulting.org" target="_blank">Healthcare Excellence Institute</a>, I help hospitals improve their funding of quality care delivery by creating models that predict insurance payments. I aspire to maximize my impact in the shifting healthcare landscape by leveraging advanced analytics to transform prevention and care coordination. Previously, I was the <strong>Director of Operations</strong> at <a href="https://www.enplug.com/" target="_blank">Enplug</a>, a tech startup featured in Inc. magazineâ€™s <a href="http://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/2015-30-under-30-enplug.html" target="_blank">30 under 30</a>. In that position, I led monthly business and operational model adjustments, developed our hardware supply chain management and techincal support, and created business intelligence reporting. 

I have a <strong>BS in Mechanical Engineering</strong> from <a href="https://barretthonors.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a>. During my Junior year, I studied structural mechanics and control systems at <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Nanyang Technological University</a> in Singapore. I am currently applying for online <strong>MS in Data Science</strong> programs for fall 2017 matriculation. 

I am proficient in <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>R</strong>, and gaining experience in <strong>Python</strong>. I am obsessed with solving problems and delivering timely analysis to stakeholders. My priority is ensuring the learning process is continuous and decision making improves with each iteration.

My hobbies include hot yoga, basketball, anything sci-fi, behavioral psychology books, mining music in Spotify, and watching water. 

I was born in Los Angeles, CA and raised in the beautiful Phoenix, AZ sonoran desert. Travels abroad have taken me on backpacking trips through Southeast Asia, Central America, and western Europe. I hope to visit Patagonia next.
